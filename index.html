		<p class="message">even though we haven't met yet, the bond that we share is already so strong. The conversations we have, the laughter we share, and the moments we spend getting to know each other have made me realize how much I adore you.</p>

		<p class="message">I am looking forward to the day we meet and start our journey together. Until then, please know that I love you deeply, and you are always on my mind and in my heart.</p>
